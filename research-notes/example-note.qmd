## Research Question

This note explores the relationship between surrogate losses and performance measures.

## Key Results

The main theorem states that for a surrogate loss $\phi$, we have:

$$
R_{\phi}(f) \leq R_{\phi}^* + \delta
$$

where $R_{\phi}^*$ is the optimal risk and $\delta$ is the approximation error.

## Proof Sketch

The proof follows from the convexity of the surrogate loss function:

$$
\phi(z) = \max_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} \left\{ \ell(y, \hat{y}) - \langle z, y \rangle \right\}
$$

## Experimental Validation

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Simulate predictions
y_true = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 1])
y_pred = np.array([0, 1, 0, 0, 1])

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```
